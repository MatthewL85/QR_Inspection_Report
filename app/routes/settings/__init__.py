# SAFE bootstrap for the Settings blueprint

from flask import Blueprint

# 1) Define the blueprint FIRST so it always exists
settings_bp = Blueprint("settings", __name__, url_prefix="/settings")

# 2) Best-effort import of submodules that register routes onto settings_bp
#    Only import modules that actually exist right now.
